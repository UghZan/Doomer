# Doomer
 Fast wave-based shooter made in ~2.5 weeks
 Heavily inspired by Doom Eternal and Serious Sam.
 Features 8 types of weapons and 4 secondary weapons, 8 enemy types and 1 boss - and also dynamic soundtrack! Do you like Kino?
 The health is dynamic and there's no health kits - you need to:
 1. Don't get hit.
 2. Kill them enemies.
 3. Hit them sweet airshots.
 Main intention was to make weapons as satisfying and as useful as possible: you can beat the game even without taking any weapons or secondaries.
